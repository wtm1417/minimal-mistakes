Hello! My name is William and I am a 4th year medical student applying into diagnostic radiology with the long term goal of improving healthcare through education and innovation.

I have always been interested in the intersection of technology and medicine and believe that advances in technology have the power to greatly improve patient care and outcomes. As a future radiologist, I am excited to be at the forefront of developing and utilizing cutting-edge technology in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.

In addition to my clinical pursuits, I am also committed to improving healthcare education with innovative methods and technologies. I believe that by equipping future healthcare professionals with the tools and knowledge they need we can collectively work towards a healthier future for all.

I am eager to continue learning and growing in my career and am excited to see where my passions and interests will take me in the future. I created this site to share my interests and current projects along the way. Thank you for visiting my website and learning more about me.
